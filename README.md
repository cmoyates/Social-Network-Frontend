# Social Network: Front-End
This is the front-end of a simple social network made with React.

See it in action here: https://cmoyates.github.io/Social-Network-Frontend/

You can take a look at the back-end here: https://github.com/cmoyates/Social-Network-Backend

## What can it do?
- Real-time messaging
- Posting
- Liking, commenting, and sharing posts
- Viewing and folowing other profiles

## How does it work?
- The bulk of what's seen on screen are react components from the Material UI component library.
- It communicates with the backend through fetch requests.
- It uses the client-side version of Socket.io for messaging.
